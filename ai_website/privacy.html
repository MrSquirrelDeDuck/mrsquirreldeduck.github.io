<h1>School Privacy</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This privacy policy describes how the student data collected by the One Page School Application is used,
and how it is protected.
</p>

<h2>What Data Is Collected</h2>
<p>
The following data is collected:
<ul>
<li>Name, email address, and a password (used to login) of the administrator</li>
<li>Names of students</li>
<li>Names of parents (optional)</li>
<li>School name, address, and phone number</li>
<li>School year</li>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Attendance</li>
<li>Grades</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>How Data Is Used</h2>
<p>
All of the data is stored in a database and is used to display the information on the website when you are logged in.
The email address and password are used to log you in to the admin panel.
</p>

<h2>How Data Is Protected</h2>
<p>
The email address and password of the administrator are encrypted with a salted hash.
The salted hash means that it would be very difficult to crack the hash and figure out the original password.
The administrator's email address is also used as an identifier in the database, so it is not possible to log in using
an email address that is not in the database.
</p>
<p>
The database is stored in a directory on the server that is not accessible to the public.
That means that nobody can access the database except for the website itself.
</p>
