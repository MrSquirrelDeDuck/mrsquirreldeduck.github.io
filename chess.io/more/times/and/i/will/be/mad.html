<h2>The rules</h2>

<p>The game is played on an 8×8 chessboard. You win by either capturing your opponent’s king, or putting them into checkmate. The game can also end in a draw.</p>

<p>The game starts with the white player making the first move, and then alternates between the two players. Each player can move one piece per turn.</p>

<p>The pieces you can move are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The king</li>
    <li>The queen</li>
    <li>The rook</li>
    <li>The bishop</li>
    <li>The knight</li>
    <li>The pawn</li>
</ul>

<p>The king can move one square in any direction. The queen can move any number of squares in any direction. The rook can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically. The bishop can move any number of squares diagonally. The knight can move two squares horizontally or vertically, and then one more square in a perpendicular direction. The pawn can move one square forward, or one square diagonally if it is capturing an opponent’s piece.</p>

<p>The game is played in turns. On your turn, you can either move one of your pieces, or you can capture an opponent’s piece. To capture a piece, you simply move one of your pieces to the square that the piece is on. If the piece you are capturing is a king, then the game is over and you have won.</p>

<p>The game can also end in a draw. A draw can occur if:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The game is not over and neither player can make a legal move.</li>
    <li>The game is not over and both players agree to a draw.</li>
    <li>The game is not over and one player has only a king left, and the other player does not have enough pieces to checkmate the king.</li>
</ul>
